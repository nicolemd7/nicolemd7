👋🏽 Hi, my name is Nicole, I am 3rd year IT Engineering Student from NMIMS Mumbai. (July 2023). My avid interest in Computers lead to me wanting to pursue a career in the IT industry, over the years my interest towards this subject has only grown, especially in the field of Machine Learning, the idea that a spreadsheet of data can provide so many insights, with applications in every field from geospatial analytics to medical research, the endless possibilities fascinate me everyday, it is this wide array of solutions that ML provides is what draws me to it!

📚 I currently spend my days improving my understanding of Machine Learning by means of small projects, I believe that if you've learnt something well, you should be able to explain it to others, so I have started writing medium articles on simple ML concepts and in time I'll work my way up to the more complex topics in Machine Learning, as for my future I aspire to be a ML Engineer
